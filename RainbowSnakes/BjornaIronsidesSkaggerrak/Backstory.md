# Bjorna "Ironsides" Skaggerrak

## Backstory: 

so, Ironsides is telling everyone that they are on a quest for fame and immortality, but really they are searching for their mother, a legendary warrior who disappeared during a civil war that tore apart Ironsides' clan

most assume that Ironsides' mother, Lagertha, died during the final, catastrophic battle, but her body was never found, so Ironsides is convinced that Lagertha is still alive

Ironsides is also in part trying to fulfill the dreams of their father, an adventurer who wanted to find new lands where he could farm and study wildlife

but Ironsides' father was mocked for such dreams (because why be a farmer and wildlife biologist when you can be a warrior??) so Ironsides also feels a bit ashamed of wanting the same things

Ironsides is on this quest to figure out if they are willing to face the mockery of the other goliaths in order to follow in the footsteps of their father

who was betrayed and killed by a foreign king somewhere, for being too adventurous and too good a warrior to be killed in battle

so someone might know Ironsides' father, Lothbrok, because he was a great adventurer and bold warrior to many, but to the goliaths, Lothbrok is a bit of a disgrace, a pacifist weakling

so Ironsides is torn between wanting to be in good standing with their fellow goliaths, to follow in the footsteps of their mother, or to see the world and appreciate its beauty like their father

ok, been meaning to send you this for forever, the backstory of Ironsides and Ursa: in Ironsides' tribe, to become a warrior, children visit the local tribal duke and are bestowed arm rings, upon which they must swear an oath of fealty to that duke. once they have done so they can choose to go into the wilderness and survive on their own for a time, and bring back a trophy of their victory over the wild. Ironsides goes into the wilderness about a year after getting their arm ring, and stays out there for a year. During late winter/early spring, they were out foraging when they came across a bear that had woken from its hibernation early because it needed food for its baby. The bear and Ironsides come upon each other by surprise, and the mama bear attacks. Ironsides wounds mama bear and barely escapes with their life, knowing that they could never single handed ly take on a bear at full strength.

Ironsides returns to their hut to recover, not realising they fatally wounded the mama bear

they go out foraging again and come across the mama bear which had been taken down by wolves

Ironsides remembers the baby and goes looking for it

befriends it by feeding it

and names it ursa

when it doesn't leave Ironsides alone after that

also Ironsides stopped wearing their arm band when civil war broke out at home, but still carries it with them

so lothbrok left just after ironsides got their arm ring

and ironsides heard many tales of a wandering peaceful goliath named Lothbrok

who would help farmers drive away monsters or goblins or dragons

and would also stick around to help them with agriculture

lothbrok visited very rarely

and the last visit happenend just before the civil war

lagertha, in the meanwhile, had grown in power, while raising ironsides and ironsides' half siblings

and had become the local duke

to whom now all children come to receive their arm rings

but one of lagertha's co-mates and ironsides' half-mother, Aslaug, grew power-hungry and envious of lagertha

aslaug is not a warrior like lagertha, but she is a renowned bard

so many love aslaug

and amongst those who do not, many consider her a powerful witch

aslaug also had 4 children with Lothbrok, and Lagertha only had Ironsides

so Aslaug and her children overthrew Lagertha and slaughtered many of Lagertha's supporters

the civil war raged for many battles, took almost a year

as lagertha tried to regain her position as duke

but then there was a battle where Aslaug surprised Lagertha with a secret alliance with a forest tribe of goliaths

and they overwhelmed Lagertha's forces

and in that battle Lagertha mysteriously disappeared

and Ironsides, after being unable to find their mother for weeks, decides to leave the mountains

both because they needed to get away from Aslaug and her children, who were hunting them and any remaining supporters of Lagertha

but also because Ironsides thought that Lagertha might have also run further away

and maybe by going farther out into the world, Ironsides could find both Lagertha and Lothbrok

ok, so part of the war between lagertha and aslaug is religious - aslaug advocates a return to the old golds, the Elisyr, arguing that they are much more present and powerful in the remote mountaintops where the Skaggerak clan (Ironsides' clan) rules.

Lagertha on the other hand advocates for an acceptance of the Valkilyr, new gods that unite many goliath clans
