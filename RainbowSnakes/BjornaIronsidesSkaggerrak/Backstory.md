# Bjorna "Ironsides" Skaggerrak

Child of Lagertha "Beast Maiden" Skaggerrak and Lothbrok "The Farmer" Ragnarrohim, born and raised in the mountain tribe of Kattegat. The seat of power and major settlement of Kattegat is the stronghold of Isfjell. 

## Extended Family

Aslaug: one of Lagertha's co-mates and Ironsides' half-mother. Aslaug has 4 children with Lothbrok. 

## Backstory

Ironsides tells everyone that they are on a quest for fame and immortality, but really they are searching for their mother, a legendary warrior who disappeared during a civil war that tore apart Ironsides' clan. Most assume that Ironsides' mother, Lagertha, died during the final, catastrophic battle of this civil war, but her body was never found, so Ironsides is convinced that Lagertha is still alive.

Ironsides is also in part trying to fulfill the dreams of their father, Lothbrok, an adventurer who wanted to find new lands where he could farm and study wildlife. But Ironsides' father was mocked for such dreams (because why be a farmer and wildlife biologist when you can be a warrior??) so Ironsides also feels a bit ashamed of wanting the same things.

## Childhood

To become a warrior of Kattegat, children visit the ruler of Kattegat and are bestowed arm rings, upon which they must swear an oath of fealty to king or queen of Kattegat. Once they have done so they can choose to go into the wilderness of the northern mountains and survive on their own for a time, and bring back a trophy of their victory over the wild. 

Just before Ironsides comes of the age to receive their arm ring, Lagertha and Lothbrok overthrew the old ruler of Kattegat. Lothbrok was only interested in removing the old ruler and not in ruling himself, so Lagertha became Queen of Kattegat. About a year after Ironsides got their arm ring, Lothbrok decides to leave Kattegat on one of his long trips into the south. Ironsides, who adores Lothbrok despite his pacifistic ways, decides to go into the wilderness to deal with Lothbrok's departure, and stays out there for a year. During late winter/early spring, Ironsides was out foraging when they came across a bear that had woken from its hibernation early because it needed food for its baby. The mother bear and Ironsides come upon each other by surprise, and the mama bear attacks. Ironsides wounds mama bear and barely escapes with their life, knowing that they could never single handedly take on a bear at full strength.

Ironsides returns to their hut to recover, not realising they fatally wounded the mama bear. After a few days, Ironsides goes out foraging again and finds the mangled body of the mama bear, which Ironsides recognized because their knife is still embedded in the bear's shoulder. The belly of the mother bear is gutted and most of the belly meat is carved out but whatever animal took down the bear couldn't deal with the thick pelt, so much of the hide is intact but now frozen. Nearby, Ironsides discovers the mother bear's hibernation cave, and inside, the baby bear. Ironsides is moved to compassion and can't help feeding the baby bear. 

Afterwards, Ironsides returns daily to check in on the baby bear to feed it. Ironsides also buries the mother bear, as they aren't able to salvage the mangled, frozen pelt. As the weeks pass, the baby bear begins to follow Ironsides around, and Ironsides names the bear Ursa. When Ironsides returns to Isfjell, Ursa comes with them. 

## The Civil War

Upon arriving back from their time in the wilderness, Ironsides discovers that their mother Lagertha has been gathering many alliances with other goliath tribes, which is unusual because Kattegat has traditionally been a distant tribe even to other goliaths. These tribes are uniting under a new pantheon of gods called the Valkilyr, who advocate for forgiveness instead of vengeance and cooperation instead of war. 

Many goliaths in Kattegat are unsure about this change to their traditions, and Aslaug is using their discomfort to scheme an overthrow of Lagertha. Aslaug has grown power-hungry and envious of Lagertha, and finds it easy to win goliaths over to her side by voicing strong support for a return to the old ways and the old gods. Aslaug argues that the old golds, the Elisyr, are much more present and powerful in the remote mountaintops of Kattegat, and that if the goliaths of Kattegat turn to the Valkilyr, the Elisyr will destroy Isfjell.

Aslaug is not a warrior like Lagertha, but she is a renowned bard and very beautiful, so while many respect Lagertha, many also love Aslaug, and those who do not consider her to be a powerful witch. At the next harvest festival after Ironsides' return from the wilderness, Aslaug and her children initiate a battle that ends with the slaughter of Lagertha's household and many of her supporters. Lagertha, Ironsides, and a small group of Lagertha's closest friends manage to escape and spend the next year trying to reinstate Lagertha as Queen of Kattegat. 

## Exile

During the final battle of the civil war, Aslaug's forces surprised and overwhelmed Lagertha's forces with a secret alliance with a tribe of cloud giants. During the end of this battle, after the cloud giants arrive, Lagertha mysteriously disappears. Ironsides is nearly captured but manages to escape with Ursa. 

After weeks of hiding from Aslaug's assassins and looking for Lagertha, Ironsides decides to leave the mountains. Ironsides thought that Lagertha might have also run further away and maybe by going farther out into the world, Ironsides could find both Lagertha and Lothbrok. When Ironsides decides to leave Kattegat and venture out into the rest of the Vale, they stop wearing their arm band (even though they still carry it with them at all times). 

## Quest

Ironsides is on this quest to fund their travels as they search for Lagertha and Lothbrok. Ironsides has heard numerous tales about how Lothbrok was supposedly betrayed and killed by a foreign king somewhere, or another goliath (for being a disgraceful pacifist). At the same time, Ironsides has also heard many tales of a wandering peaceful goliath named Lothbrok who helps farmers drive away monsters or goblins or dragons, and who also sticks around to help with farming and animal husbandry. Ironsides has heard nothing about Lagertha or her wherabouts.
